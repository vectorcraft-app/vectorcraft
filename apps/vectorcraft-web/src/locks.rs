//! The browser's Web Locks (`navigator.locks`), which tell Data Recovery whether another tab still
//! runs ([`vectorcraft_engine::cmd::recovery::RecoveryStore::announce`]). A tab holds a lock named
//! after its recovery area for as long as it lives; the browser releases it only when the tab is
//! gone (closed, crashed or reloaded), not while its timers are paused in the background, which a
//! heartbeat can't tell apart.
//!
//! web-sys has Web Locks only as an unstable API, so they are reached through `js_sys::Reflect`.
//! Pages that aren't secure (plain `http://` other than localhost) and older browsers have none:
//! heartbeats alone decide there.
