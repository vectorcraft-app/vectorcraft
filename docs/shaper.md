# Shaper

Sketch a basic shape with the Shaper tool (Shift+N). Rectangles, squares and ellipses snap to 45° rotation steps; hexagons to 90°. Triangles point up or down; sideways sketches snap to one of those orientations. Lines keep the angle you draw, including while Shift is held.

Scribble over overlapping paths to make an editable Shaper Group:

- Start in a filled region and cross into other regions to merge the regions touched. The result uses the starting region’s fill.
- Scribble within a region to remove its fill and keep its stroke. Hidden overlap boundaries are part of the same visible face; visible dividing strokes create separate faces.
- End the scribble outside the artwork to remove the touched fills and exposed boundary strokes. Shared edges along surviving filled areas remain, closing their contours. Compatible stroke pieces join at the new corners, so the selected stroke’s join style applies there.
- Scribble over an unfilled stroke segment to remove that piece. A line passing through a shape is split at the intersections, so its protruding ends can be removed separately.

Click once to select the group; click again to select its visible fill and change its color. Double-click with Shaper to enter construction editing and select an original shape. The Selection tool then moves or resizes it normally, and the visible composition updates. Escape leaves construction editing. The original live shapes and edit recipes survive native save/reopen. Outside construction editing, selection highlights and bounds show only the visible result.

Object › Shaper › Release restores the original paths. Expand keeps the visible result as ordinary paths. Each scribble and source edit records one undo step. Sources in a composition must share a parent layer/group; Shaper limits a composition to 64 source paths and 4,096 segments.

The construction-mode arrow widget and finer gesture heuristics remain to be implemented.
